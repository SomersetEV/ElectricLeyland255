Adaptor plates are made from mostly 10mm laser cut steel plates, with one 8mm plate.
Once cut, use 8mm dowels to ensure parts are indexed correctly. Then bolt together and weld.
Between the plates are two 7208 BEP bearings designed to hold the Brat Industries leaf motor adaptor. To this adaptor you can heat shrink on the flywheel adaptor.

Designed to bolt onto the orginal bell housing.



11/01/2026: Added Flywheel delete parts. Not necessary, but if you want to remove the flywheel and clutch these parts will sandwidge the clutch centres for the drive and PTO. Then bolt into the flywheel adaptor. Also included are alignment parts you can print off to keep everything centred.
